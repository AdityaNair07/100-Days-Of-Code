<h1 align="center">Correctness and the loop invariant</h1>

- Created the main class.
- Inside the class defined a static void return type method named insertionSort() that takes integer array A as parameter.
- Inside the method declared a for loop that runs from 1 to length of A.
- Inside the loop declared integer variable value that stores ith element of A.
- Then declared an integer variable j that stores i-1 value.
- Then defined a while loop that runs till j is greater than or equal to 0 and the jth element of A is greater than value.
- Inside the while loop j+1th position stores jth elemnt of A.
- j value is decremented by 1.
- After the while loop ends j+1th position of A stores value variable's value.
- Then calling printArray() method that takes A as argument.
- Defined a static void return type method printArray() that takes integer array ar as parameter.
- Inside the method defined a for each loop that iterates through the elements of ar array and printing the elements.
- Inside the main method created an object of Scanner class in that takes user input.
- Then declared an integer n that takes integer user input.
- Declared an integer array ar of n size.
- Then defined a for loop that runs from 0 to n.
- Inside the loop integer user input is stored at ith position.
- Finally calling insertionSort() method that takes ar as argument.
- Hence providing the output.
