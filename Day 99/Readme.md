<h1 align="center">String Construction</h1>

- First created a class Result.
- Inside the class defined a static integer return type method stringConstruction() that takes String s as parameter.
- Inside the method declared an integer variable count that is initialised to 0.
- Then declared an integer array a of size 26.
- Then defined a for loop that runs from 0 to length of s.
- Inside the loop incrementing the value at index, character at ith index - 'a' of a array.
- Then defined another for loop that runs from 0 to length of a.
- Inside the loop defined an if condition that checks if ith element of a is not equal to 0.
- If the condition is satisfied then count value is incremented.
- The method returns count value.
- Hence providing the output.
