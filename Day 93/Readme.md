<h1 align="center">Find Digits</h1>

- First created a class Result.
- Inside the class defined a static integer return type method findDigits() that takes integer variable n as parameter.
- Inside the method declared integer variables count that is initialised to 0 and num that stores n.
- Then defined a while loop that runs till n is greater than 0.
- Inside the loop declared an integer variable rem that stores n divided by 10 remainder.
- Then defined an if condition that checks if rem is not equal to 0 and num divided by rem is equal to 0.
- If yes then count value is incremented.
- n value is updated to n divided by 10.
- The method returns count value.
- Hence providing the output.
