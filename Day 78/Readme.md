<h1 align="center">Breaking Records</h1>

- First created a class Result.
- Inside the class defined a static List of Integer type breakingRecords() that takes List of Integer (scores) as parameter.
- Inside the method declared integer variables.
- lowestRecord that stores 0th index element.
- highestRecord that stores 0th index element.
- Integer variable lowestRecordCount and highestRecordCount that are initialised to 0.
- Declared list of integer type records.
- Defined a for loop that runs from 1 to size of scores.
- Inside the loop defined an if condition that checks if the element at ith index of scores is greater than highestRecord.
- If yes highestRecord stores the element and highestRecordCount is incremented.
- Else if ith element of scores if smaller than lowestRecord
- If yes lowestRecord stores the element and lowestRecordCount is incremented.
- Then adding highestRecordCount and lowestRecordCount to records using add().
- The method returns records.
- The main class BreakingRecords with the main method.
- Inside the main method created object of BufferedReader br that takes user input using object of InputStreamReader.
- Created an object of BufferedWriter that provides output using object of FileWriter object.
- Declared an integer variable n that takes user input.
- Declared a list of integer scores that stores Integer user input.
- Declared a list of Integer result that stores breakingRecords() method that takes scores as argument.
- Hence providing the output.
