<h1 align="center">Mini-Max Sum</h1>

- First created a class Result.
- Defined a static void return type method named miniMaxSum() that takes List of Integer type (arr) as parameter.
- Inside the method declared a long variable sum that is initialised to 0.
- Sorting the list using sort() method.
- Defined a for each loop that iterates through the list (arr).
- Inside the loop the elements in arr are added to the sum variable.
- Printing the minimum and maximum sum.
- Then created the main class with main method.
- Inside the main method created an object of BufferedReader br that takes user input using InputStreamReader.
- Declared a list of integer type named arr that stores user input.
- Calling miniMaxSum() method and passing arr as argument.
- Hence providing the output.
