- First created the main class CatsAndMouse.
- Inside the class defined a static String return type method catAndMouse() that takes integer variables x,y and z as parameters.
- Inside the method declared an empty String variable result.
- Then defined an if-else condition.
- If the absolute difference between z and x is greater than the absolute difference between z and y, then result stores Cat B as String value.
- Else if the absolute difference between z and x is smaller than the absolute difference between z and y, then result stores Cat A as String value.
- Else result stores Mouse C as String value.
- The method returns result.
- Declared private static final object of Scanner scanner that takes user input.
- Inside the main method created an object of BufferedWriter bw that provides output.
- Declared an integer variable q that takes Integer user input.
- Defined a for loop that runs from 0 to q.
- Inside the loop declared String array xyz that stores user input.
- Declared three integer variables x,y and z that stores Integer values at index 0, 1 and 2.
- Declared a String result that stores catAndMouse() output that takes x,y and z as arguments.
- Finally printing result value using write().
- Hence providing output.
