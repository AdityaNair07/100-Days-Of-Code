<h1 align="center">Singleton Pattern</h1>

"The singleton pattern is a design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one object. This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system."

- First, created a class named Singleton.
- Inside the class defined a private non parameterised constructor.
- Then, declared a public String variable named str.
- Then, defined a static method named getSingleInstance of type Singleton that returns Singleton class instance.
- Hence, providing the output.
