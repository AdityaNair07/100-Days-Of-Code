<h1 align="center">Strange Counter</h1>

- First created a class Result.
- Inside the class defined a static long return type method strangeCounter() that takes long t variable as parameter.
- Inside the method declared two long variables strangeCounter and timerCount that are initialised to 3 and 1 respectively.
- Then defined a while loop that runs till t is greater than timerCount and the sum of timerCount & strangeCounter is equal to less than t.
- Inside the while loop adding strangeCounter value to timerCount and strangeCounter value is incremented by multiplying by 2.
- The method returns the difference between strangeCounter and the difference between t and timerCount.
- Hence providing the output.
