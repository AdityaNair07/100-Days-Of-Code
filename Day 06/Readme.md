<h1 align="center">End of file</h1>

- We have to read the user input till the end of the file.
- We then have to print the number of line as output.
- Here we first initialise a variable count as 0 (count=0).
- In the next step, we define a while loop which runs till an error is detected.
- Inside the loop, we define try catch block.
- Inside the try block, we take user input/ read the lines.
- Then after reading a line we increment the value of count.
- After incrementing, we print the count value followed by the input.
- Inside the catch block, we check for exceptions if an exception occurs we break the while loop.
- Hence, giving the output.
