<h1 align="center">BST Level Order Traversal</h1>

- First created a class named Node.
- Inside the class declared Node type variables left and right.
- Then declared an integer variable named data.
- Then created a constructor that takes integer variable named data.
- Inside the constructor, data is accessed using this keyword; left and right variable are initialised to null.
- Then created the main class named BSTLevelOrderTraversal.
- Then defined a static void return type method named levelOrder() that takes Node root as parameter.
- Inside the method created a linked list of type Node named queue.
- Then adding root to queue using add() method.
- Then defined a while loop that runs till the first element is not null using peek() method.
- Inside the loop, created Node object named node that stores queue head using remove() method.
- Then printing node data.
- Then defined if conditions.
- If node left value is not equal to null, then add node left to queue using add() method.
- If node right value is not equal to null, then add node right to queue using add() method.
- If the first element of queue is not equal to null, then printing empty String.
- Then created a static Node type method named insert() that takes Node root and integer variable data as parameter.
- Inside the method defined if-else condition.
- If root is equal to null, then return new Node with data as argument.
- Else declared Node variable cur.
- Defined an if-else condition.
- If data is smaller than or equal root data, then cur stores insert() method output using root.left and data as argument.
- And root left stores cur value.
- Else cur stores insert() method output using root.right and data as argument.
- And root right stores cur value.
- The method returns root.
- The main method is defined.
- Inside the main method created an object of Scanner class named sc that takes user input.
- Then declared an integer variable named T that takes integer user input.
- Node root is declared and initialised to null.
- Then defined a while loop that runs till T becomes 0.
- Inside the loop, declared integer variable named data that stores integer user input.
- root stores output of insert() method that takes root and data as argument.
- Then calling levelOrder() method that takes root as argument.
- Hence providing the output.
