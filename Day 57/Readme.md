- First created a class named Difference.
- Inside the class created a private integer array named elements and public integer variable named maximumDifference.
- Then created a constructor that takes integer array as parameter.
- Inside the constructor the array is accessed.
- Then created a public method of void return type named computeDifference().
- Inside the method declared two integer variables min and max that are initialised to element at 0th index of array elements.
- Then defined a for loop that runs from 0 to length of elements array.
- Inside the loop, defined two if conditions.
- If the element at ith index of elements array is smaller than min variable value, then store that element in min variable.
- If the element at ith index of elements array is greater than max variable value, then store that element in max variable.
- maximumDifference variable stores the absolute difference between max and min variable using abs() method of Math package.
- Then created the main class with main method.
- Inside the main method created an object of Scanner class named sc that takes user input.
- Declared an integer variable n that takes integer user input.
- Then declared an integer array a of size n.
- Then defined a for loop that runs from 0 to n.
- Inside the loop, storing user input in array.
- Created an object of Difference class named difference; the constructor takes a array as argument.
- Calling computeDifference() method using difference object.
- Then printing the maximumDifference variable value using that object.
- Hence providing the output.
