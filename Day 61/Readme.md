<h1 align="center">Binary Search Tree</h1>

- First created a Node named class.
- Inside the class declared two Node type variables left and right.
- Declared an integer variable named data.
- Then created a constructor that takes integer variable (data) as parameter.
- Inside the constructor accessing data using this keyword and initialising left and right to null.
- Created the main class named BinarySearchTree.
- Defined a static integer return type method named getHeight() that takes Node root as parameter.
- Inside the method, declared two integer variables heightleft and heightright that are initialised to 0.
- Then defined two if conditions.
- If the root.left is not equal to null, then heightleft stores getHeight() with root.left as parameter and add by 1.
- If the root.right is not equal to null, then heightright stores getHeight() with root.right as parameter and add by 1.
- Return ternary operator output i.e. heigthleft is greater than heightright then return heightleft else return heightright.
- Then defined static Node type method named insert() that takes Node root and integer variable (data) as parameter.
- Inside the method defined if-else condition.
- If root is equal to null, then return new Node with data as argument.
- Else declared Node type variable cur.
- Inside else defined if-else condition.
- If data is smaller than or equal to root data, then cur stores insert() method output; root left and data are passed as argument.
- root left stores cur variable value.
- Else cur stores insert() method output; root right and data are passed as argument.
- root right stores cur variable value.
- Return root.
- Then defined the main method.
- Inside the main method created an object of Scanner class named sc that takes user input.
- Declared an integer variable T that takes integer user input.
- Created Node type variable root that is initialised to null.
- Then defined while loop that runs till T becomes 0. 
- Inside the loop declared an integer variable data that takes integer user input.
- root stores the output of insert() method that takes root and data as argument.
- Declared an integer variable height that stores getHeight() method output with root as argument.
- Finally printing the heigth variable value.
- Hence providing the output.
