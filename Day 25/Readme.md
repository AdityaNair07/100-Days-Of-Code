<h1 align="center">ArrayList</h1>

- First, create an ArrayList of ArrayList of Integer type named arrayList.
- Then created another ArrayList of Integer type named temp.
- Then take an integer input using Scanner class and store it in a variable n.
- Declare and initialise an integer variable named m to 0.
- Then defined a for loop that runs from 0 to n.
- Inside the loop, take integer input from user and update the value of variable m.
- Then defined another for loop that runs from 0 to m.
- Take user input and add them to the ArrayList temp.
- After the inner loop is exited, inside the outer loop.
- Add the elements of temp ArrayList into the first ArrayList named arrayList.
- Clear the temp ArrayList using clear function.
- After the loop is exited, take integer user input and store it in an integer variable q.
- Then defined a for loop that runs from 0 to q.
- Inside the loop, declared a try catch block.
- Inside the try block, printing the elements of arrayList, using get method.
- Inside the catch block, printing "ERROR".
