<h1 align="center">Running Time and Complexity</h1>

- First created a class named RunningTimeandComplexity.
- Defined a static boolean return type method named isPrime() that takes integer variable number as parameter.
- Inside the method defined an if-else condition.
- If number is smaller than or equal to 1 then return false.
- Else defined a for loop that runs from 2 to square root of number.
- Inside the loop defined an if condition that checks if number is divisible by divisor.
- If yes then return false.
- Else returns true.
- Inside the main method created an object of Scanner class named sc that takes user input.
- Declared an integer variable testCases that takes integer user input.
- Defined a for loop that runs from 0 to testCases value.
- Inside the loop declared an integer variable inputNumber that takes integer user input.
- Declared a boolean variable named isPrime that stores isPrime() method output that takes inputNumber as argument.
- Defined an if-else condition.
- If isPrime returns true then print Prime.
- Else print Not Prime.
- Hence providing the output.
