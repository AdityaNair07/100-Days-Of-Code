<h1 align="center">Alternating Characters</h1>

- First created a class Result.
- Inside the class defined a static integer return type method alternatingCharacters() that takes String variable s as paramter.
- Inside the method declared an intege variable count that is initialised to 0.
- Then defined a for loop that runs from 0 to length of String s.
- Inside the loop defined another loop that runs from i+1 to length of String s.
- Inside the inner loop defined an if condition that checks if character at ith index and jth index are equal.
- If yes then count value is incremented.
- And i value is incremented if not equal.
- The method returns count value.
- Inside the main method of the main class created an object of BufferedReader br that takes user input using object of InputStreamReader.
- Created an object of BufferedWriter bw that provides output using object of FileWriter.
- Then declared an integer variable q that takes integer user input.
- Then defined a for each loop that runs for value of q.
- Inside the loop declared String variable s that takes String user input and an integer variable result that stores the output of alternatingCharacters() method that takes s as argument.
- Finally printing the value of result using write() method.
- Hence providing the output.
