<h1 align="center">Java HashSet</h1>

- First, created an object of Scanner class to take input from user.
- Declared an integer variable t that takes integer user input.
- Then two String arrays are declared named pair_left and pair_right having size of t.
- Then, declared a for loop that runs from 0 to t.
- Inside the loop take two String user inputs and store them in the String arrays sequentially.
- After exiting the loop, created a HashSet of type String.
- Then declared another for loop that runs from 0 to t.
- Inside this loop, declared a String n that stores the values of the String arrays pair_left and pair_right seperated with an underscore.
- Then, adding the String n to the HashSet set using the add method.
- Finally, printing the size of the HashSet set using the size method.
- Hence providing the output.
