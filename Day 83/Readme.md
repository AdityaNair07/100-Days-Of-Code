<h1 align="center">Utopian Tree</h1>

- First created a class Result.
- Inside the class defined a static integer return type method utopianTree() that takes integer variable n as parameter.
- Inside the method declared an integer variable height that is initialised to 1.
- Then defined an if-else condition.
- If n is equal to 0 then the method returns height i.e. 1.
- Else defined a for loop that runs from 1 to n.
- Inside the loop defined an if-else condition.
- If i is divisible by 2, then height value is incremented.
- Else height value is multiplied by 2.
- The method returns the height value.
- Created the main class with main method.
- Inside the main method created an object of BufferedReader br that takes user input using InputStreamReader object.
- Created an object of BufferedWriter bw that provides output using object of FileWriter.
- Declared an integer variable t that takes integer user input as number of test cases.
- Declared two integer variables n that takes integer user input and result that stores utopianTree() method output.
- Finally printing the value of result value using write() method.
- This process runs for the number of testcases.
- Hence providing the output.
