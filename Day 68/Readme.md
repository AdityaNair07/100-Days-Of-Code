<h1 align="center">Bitwise AND</h1>

- First created a class named Result.
- Inside the class defined a static integer return type method named bitwiseAnd() that takes two integer variables as parameters(n,k).
- Inside the method declared an integer variable max that stores the minimum value of integer using MIN_VALUE.
- Then defined a for loop that runs from 1 to N.
- Inside the loop defined another loop that runs from i+1 to N.
- Inside the loop declared an integer variable named result that stores i & j output.
- Defined an if condition that checks if result is smaller than K and the result is greater than max.
- If yes max stores result value.
- The method returns max.
- Created the main class with the main method.
- Inside the main method created object of BufferedReader named br that takes user input using object of InputStreamReader.
- Created object of BufferedWriter named bw that gives output using object of FileWriter.
- Declared integer variable t that stores user input after removing the whitespaces before and after the input using trim() method and type casting to integer using parseInt() method.
- IntStream method range() is used that returns a sequential ordered IntStream from startInclusive (inclusive) to endExclusive (exclusive) by an incremental step of 1; 0 and N are passed as the arguments.
- Defined a forEach loop.
- Inside the loop defined a try-catch block.
- Inside the try block created a String array named firstMultipleInput that stores user input after replacing the regular expression and splitting using split() method.
- Declared an integer variable count that stores the first element of firstMultipleInput after type casting it to integer using parseInt() method.
- Declared an integer variable lim that stores the second element of firstMultipleInput after type casting it to integer using parseInt() method.
- Declared an integer variable res that stores bitwiseAnd() method output that takes count and lim as arguments.
- Then printing the value of res using write() method and type casting it to String.
- Inside the catch block defined a new exception RuntimeException.
- Hence providing the output.
