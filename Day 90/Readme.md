<h1 align="center">Jumping on the Clouds</h1>

- First created a class Result.
- Inside the class defined a static integer return type method jumpingOnClouds() that takes List of integer c as parameter.
- Inside the method declared an integer variable count that is initialised to 0.
- Then defined a for loop that runs from 0 to c size.
- Inside the loop defined an if condition that checks if the ith element of c is equal to 1.
- If yes, then i value is decremented.
- Defined another if condition that checks if i is equal to c size-2 value and the last element of c is equal to 0.
- If yes then count value is incremented.
- count value is incremented inside the for loop.
- The method returns count-1 as output.
- Inside the main method of the main class created an object of BufferedReader br that takes user input using object of InputStreamReader.
- Then created an object of BufferedWriter bw that provides output using object of FileWriter.
- Declared an integer variable n that takes integer user input.
- Declared a list of integer type c that stores integer inputs.
- Declared an integer variable result that stores jumpingOnClouds() method output that takes c as argument.
- Finally printing the value of result using write() method.
- Hence providing the output.
