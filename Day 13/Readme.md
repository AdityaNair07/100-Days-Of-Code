<h1 align="center">Prime Number using BigInteger</h1>
A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 whose only positive divisors are 1 and itself. For example, the first six prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13.

Given a large integer, n, use the Java BigInteger class' isProbablePrime method to determine and print whether it's prime or not prime.

- First we take user input as String (n).
- Then we create an object of BigInterger class and pass n as argument of constructor of BigInteger class.
- Then we define an if-else condition.
- Inside the if condition we check if the value of object b of class BigInteger is prime or not.
- We use the isProbablePrime function which returns boolean value and we initialise it to 1 i.e. true.
- In simple words if the isProbablePrime returns true we print prime.
- Else we print not prime.
- Hence giving the desired output.
