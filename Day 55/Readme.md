- First created a class named Result.
- Inside the class created a public static method of Integer return type named factorial that takes an Integer variable n as parameter.
- Inside this method defined an if-else condition.
- If n is less than equal to 1, then return 1.
- Else return the method itself with n-1 as parameter and multiplied by n.
- Then created the main class with main method.
- Inside the main method created an object of BufferedReader class named br that takes user input using object of InputStreamReader.
- Then created an object of BufferedWriter class named bw that writes text to character-output stream using FileWriter object.
- Then declared an Integer variable n that takes user input and typecast it to Integer using parseInt() method.
- Declared another Integer variable result that stores factorial() method output.
- Then write the result variable value using write() method .
- Hence providing the output.
