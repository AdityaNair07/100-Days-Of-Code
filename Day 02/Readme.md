<h1>Inheritance</h1>

- First we created a class named Animal.
- Inside the class we defined a void return type method named walk.
- We print "I am walking".
- Then we defined another class named Bird that inherits the class Animal using extends keyword.
- Then we defined two methods named fly() and sing() that have void return type.
- At last we create the main class and main method in it.
- We then create an object bird of class Bird and allocate memory to the object.
- And call the methods walk,fly and sing using the object.
