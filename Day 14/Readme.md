<h1 align="center">BigInteger</h1>
In this problem, you have to add and multiply huge numbers! These numbers are so big that you can't contain them in any ordinary data types like a long integer.

Use the power of Java's BigInteger class and solve this problem.

- We import BigInteger class from math module.
- Inside the main function, we take user input and for taking user input we use Scanner class.
- Declare two string variables a and b which take string input from the user.
- Then we create two objects of BigInteger class.
- BigInteger class is useful when working with huge numbers that can't be stored even in long data type.
- When the two objects of BigInteger are created, the constructors of BigInteger i.- BigInteger() is passed with arguments.
- The arguments that are passed in the constructors are the user input a and b.
- After that we make use of BigInteger functions.
- Add and multiply functions which perform on the two objects created.
- We access the functions using dot(.) after the object of BigInteger.
- After dot(.) we are given list of function that can be performed.
- We choose add and multiply funtion.
- The add and multiply functions take arguments to perform operations.
- The argument is the other object.(b2)
- Finally printing the output of the operations.
