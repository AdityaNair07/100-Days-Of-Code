<h1 align="center">Staircase</h1>

- First created a class named Result.
- Inside the class defined static void return type method named staircase() that takes integer variable n as parameter.
- Inside the method defined a nested for loop.
- The outer loop runs from 1 to n.
- The inner loop runs from 1 to n.
- Inside the inner loop defined an if condition that checks if j is smaller than or equal to n-i.
- If yes then printing space.
- Else printing #.
- Inside the outer loop printing next line.
- Then declared the main class with main method.
- Inside the main method created an object of BufferedReader br that takes user input using object of InputStreamReader.
- Declared an integer variable n that stores user input after type casting it to integer using parseInt() method.
- Calling staircase() method and passing n as argument.
- Hence providing the output.
