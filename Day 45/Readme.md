<h1 align="center">Java Priority Queue</h1>

A priority queue is an abstract data type which is like a regular queue, but where additionally each element has a "priority" associated with it. In a priority queue, an element with high priority is served before an element with low priority.

- First created a class named Student.
- Inside the class, declared an Integer variable id, a String variable name and a Double type variable cgpa.
- Then created a constructor which takes an Integer, a String and a Double variable as parameter.
- Inside the constructor accessing the id, name and cgpa variables using this keyword.
- Then defined an Integer return type method named getID that returns id.
- Then defined a String return type method named getName that returns name.
- Then defined a Double return type method named getCGPA that returns cgpa.
- After exiting this class, created another class named Priorities.
- Inside the class, defined a List of Student type method named getStudents that takes a List of String type (events) as parameter. 
- Inside the method, created a List of Student type named studentlist.
- Then defined a for each loop that iterates through the List of String passed as parameter.
- Inside the loop, created a String array named temp that stores the elements of event List by splitting them through spaces.
- Then defined an if-else condition.
- The if condition checks if the element at 0 index of temp array is equal to "ENTER" using equals method.
- If the condition satisfies, created a Student class object named student that takes the element at 3rd index, element at 1st index and element at 2nd index of temp array.
- Then added student object to studentlist using add method.
- Else if condition checks if the element at 0 index of temp array is equal to "SERVED".
- If the condition satisfies then inside the else if condition, execute the if condition.
- The if condition checks if the studentlist is not empty i.e it runs if the outcome of isEmpty() method is false.
- Then studentlist stores the outcome of comparing of getCGPA, getName and getID outputs in sorted order.
- Then remove the element at 0 index of studentlist using remove method.
- Finally return the studentlist.
- Then created the main class with main method.
- Inside the main class created a final static Scanner class object named sc that takes user input.
- And created a final static object of Priorities class.
- Inside the main method, created an Integer variable named totalEvents that takes String user input and parse it into Integer type using parseInt method.
- Then created a list of String type named events.
- Then defined a while loop that runs till totalEvents becomes 0.
- Inside the loop, created String variable named event that takes String user input.
- Then add the input to events list using add method.
- Then created a List of Student class objects named students that stores getStudents() method output using Priorities class object and passing events as argument in the method.
- Then, defined an if-else condition.
- The if condition checks if the students list is empty or not.
- If the outcome is true, then print "EMPTY".
- Else, defined a for each loop that iterates through students list elements.
- Inside the loop, printing the names using getName() method.
- Hence providing the output.
