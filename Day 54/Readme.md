Key-Value pair mappings using a Map or Dictionary data structure.

- First created the main class with main method.
- Inside the main method created an object of Scanner class named in that takes user input.
- Then declared an Integer variable named n that takes Integer user input.
- Then created a Map object that has String type key and Integer type mapped values.
- And referenced the object named myMap to object of HashMap.
- Then defined a for loop that runs from 0 to n.
- Inside the loop, declared a String variable name that takes String user input.
- Declared an Integer variable phone that takes Integer user input.
- Then using put() method that associates the specified value with the specified key in this map; passing name and phone as argument.
- Then defined while loop that runs till user gives input.
- Then declared a String s that takes String user input.
- Then defined an if-else condition.
- If s is equal to null or using get() method of myMap is equal to null.
- If yes, then print "Not found".
- Else print s variable value.
- Hence giving the output.
