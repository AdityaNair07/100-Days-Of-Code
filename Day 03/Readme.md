<h1>Inheritance 2</h1>

- First we define a class named Arithmetic.
- Inside the class we define a integer return type function named add.
- The function takes two integer parameters(a and b) and returns the sum of those two variables.
- Then we define an empty class named Adder which inherits the properties and behaviour of Arithmetic using extends keyword.
- In the next step we define the main method within the main class.
- We then create an object named a of the class Adder and we allocate memeory to it.
- In the next step we print the class name and the parent class name.
- This is done using the getName() method using the dot notation of the object (a).
- To get the names of the class we use getClass method and to get the parent/super class we use getSuperclass method.
- Then we print these on the screen.
- Finally we print the output of the add funtion with two integer arguments.
- We print the output that the add function gives on three different integer arguments.
