<h1 align="center">Angry Professor</h1>

- Created a class Result.
- Inside the class defined a static String return type angryProfessor() method that takes integer k and List of integer a as parameter.
- Inside the method declared an integer variable p that is initialised to 0.
- Declared a String variable s that is an empty.
- Defined a for loop that runs from 0 to size of a.
- Inside the loop defined an if condition that checks if the ith element of list a is smaller than or equal to 0.
- Then p value is incremented.
- Then defined if-else condition.
- If p is greater than or equal to k then s stores NO as string.
- Else s stores YES as string.
- The method returns s value.
- Then created main class with main method.
- Inside the main method created object of BufferedReader br that takes user input using object of InputStreamReader.
- Then created object of BufferedWriter bw provides output using object of FileWriter.
- Declared an integer variable t that takes integer user input.
- Declared String array firstMultipleInput that stores user input.
- Declared two integer variables that stores first and second element of firstMultipleInput.
- Declared a List of integer type a that stores integer user input.
- Then declared String variable result that stores angryProfessor() method output that takes k and a as argument.
- Finally printing result value using write() method.
- Hence providing the output.
