<h1 align="center">Can You Access?</h1>

- First created the main class with main method.
- Inside the main method, defined a try-catch block.
- Inside the try block, created a BufferedReader class object named br that takes user input using object of InputStreamReader.
- Then created an Integer variable named num that reads user input after removing the whitespaces at the beginning and end of the input using trim() method.
- Then the input is typecasted to Integer using parseInt() method.
- Then created an Object class object named o.
- Then o is used to hold the reference of the instance of the class Solution.Inner.Private.
- Then printing the num variable value and the output of powerof2() method with num as argument.
- The powerof2() method is accessed by using the object of Inner class and Private class.
- Then printing the class name of object o using the getClass() method.
- After exiting the try block, the catch block catches any exception and displays a message.
- Then declared a Static class named Inner.
- Inside the class created another class named Private that has Private access specifier.
- Inside the class created a private String return type method named powerof2 that takes integer variable (num) as parameter.
- The method checks ternary condition, num and num-1 are equal to 0. 
- If the outcome is true then print power of 2.
- Else print not a power of 2.
- The method returns the output of a ternary condition.
- Hence providing the output.
