- Inside the main method, declared an integer variable named initialNum.
- It takes integer input from the user.
- Then created a list of integer type named numbers.
- Then defined a for loop, which runs from 0 to initialNum.
- Inside the for loop, take integer user input and add them to the list numbers until the loop terminates.
- Declared an integer variable named q which takes integer user input. 
- Then defined another for loop which runs from 0 to q.
- Inside the loop, declared a String variable named query which takes String input from user until the loop terminates.
- Then defined an if-else condition.
- Inside the if condition check if the String query is equal to "Insert" or not by using equals method.
- The equal method is used by the String variable query and compares to the parameter in equal method. 
- If yes, then add integer user input to the numbers list.
- Else, remove the integer user input from the numbers list using remove method.
- Afte the loop ends, defined a for each loop.
- The for each loop iterates through the numbers list.
- Inside the for each loop printing the elements of the numbers list.
- Hence giving the required output.
