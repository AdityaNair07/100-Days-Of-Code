<h1 align="center">Time Conversion</h1>

- First created a class named Result.
- Defined a static String return type method named timeConversion() that takes String s as parameter.
- Inside the method declared four String variables.
- hrs stores the substring from 0 to 2 i.e. hrs.
- min stores the substring from 3 to 5 i.e. min.
- sec stores the substring from 6 to 8 i.e. sec.
- ampm stores the substring from 8 to 10 i.e. am or pm.
- Then defined an if condition that checks if ampm is equal to AM and hrs is equal to 12.
- If yes then hrs stores 00.
- Else if ampm is equal to PM and hrs is equal to 12 then hrs stores 12.
- Else if ampm is equal to PM then declared an integer variable named hr that stores hrs value after typecasting to Integer using parseInt() method.
- 12 is added to hr value.
- hrs stores hr value after typecasting to String using toString() method.
- The method returns hrs, min and sec.
- Created the main class with main method.
- Inside the main method created an object of BufferedReader br that takes user input using object of InputStreamReader.
- Created an object of BufferedWriter bw that outputs result using object of FileWriter.
- Declared a String variable s that takes String user input.
- Declared a String variable result that stores the output of timeConversion() method that takes s as argument.
- Finally printing the result value.
