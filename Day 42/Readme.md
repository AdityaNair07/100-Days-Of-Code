<h1 align="center">Java Prime Checker</h1>

- First created a class named Prime.
- Inside the class, created a void return type function named checkPrime that takes Integer numbers as parameter (using varargs functionality to take dynamic input).
- Inside the function defined for loop that runs from 0 to length of numbers.
- Inside the loop, defined an if condition that checks if the elements in numbers is prime or not using the isPrime() function.
- After exiting the condition and loop, printing a new line.
- Then defined the boolean return type isPrime() funtion that takes integer parameter input named num.
- Inside the function defined an if-else ladder.
- If num is smaller than 2 or num is completely divisible by 2 and num is not equal to 2 ,then return false.
- Else if num is equal to 2 ,then return true.
- Then declared an integer variable named sqrt that stores the square root of num variable using sqrt function of Math package and then type casting it to integer.
- Then defined a for loop, that runs from 3 to less than equal to sqrt variable value.
- Inside the loop, defined an if condition that checks if num variable is completely divisible by i or not.
- If yes then return false.
- The return type of isPrime() function is set to true.
- Then created the main class with main method.
- Inside the main method, created an object of Prime class named prime.
- Then created an object of Scanner class named sc that takes user input.
- Then declared an integer array named numbers that has size of 5.
- Then defined a for loop that runs from 0 to 5.
- Inside the loop, storing user integer input to numbers array.
- Using prime object to access checkPrime function that takes numbers array element at (length of array - 5)th index.
- Using prime object to access checkPrime function that takes numbers array element at (length of array - 5)th index and element at (length of array - 4)th index.
- Using prime object to access checkPrime function that takes numbers array element at (length of array - 5)th index and element at (length of array - 4)th index and element at (length of array - 3)th index.
- Using prime object to access checkPrime function that takes numbers array element at (length of array - 5)th index and element at (length of array - 4)th index and element at (length of array - 3)th index and element at (length of array - 2)th index and element at (length of array - 1)th index.
- Exiting the main method.
- Hence providing the output.
