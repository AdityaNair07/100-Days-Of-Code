<h1 align="center">Electronic Shop</h1>

- First created the class ElectronicShop.
- Inside the class defined a static integer return type method getMoneySpent() that takes two integer arrays keyboards and drives and an integer variable b as parameters.
- Inside the method declared an integer variable mostExpensive that is initialised to -1.
- Then defined for loop that runs from 0 to keyboard array length.
- Inside the loop defined that runs from 0 to drives array length.
- Inside the loop declared an integer variable sum that stores ith element of keyboards array and jth element of drives array.
- Then defined an if condition that checks if sum is smaller than or equal to b and sum is greater than mostExpensive.
- If yes then mostExpensive variable stores sum value.
- The method returns mostExpensive value.
- Hence providing the output.
