<h1 align="center">Java HashMap</h1>

- First created an object of Scanner class to take input.
- Then created a HashMap of String and Integer datatype named phoneBook.
- Declared an integer variable named n that takes integer user input.
- Then defined a for loop that runs from 0 to n.
- Inside the loop, String variable name takes String user input.
- Another variable of integer type named phone takes integer user input.
- After the for loop, defined a while loop that runs till the user inputs value.
- Inside the loop, declared a String variable named s that takes String user input.
- Defined an if-else condition.
- The if condition checks if the phoneBook contains the key s.
- If yes, then print the key and the corresponding value to it.
- Else, print "Not found".
- The loop is then exited giving the output.
