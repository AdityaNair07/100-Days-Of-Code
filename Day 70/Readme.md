<h1 align="center">Plus Minus</h1>

- First created a class named Result.
- Inside the class defined a static void return type method named plusMinus() that takes List of Integer type (arr).
- Inside the method declared three integer variables negative,positive and zeros that are initialised to 0.
- Defined a for loop that runs from 0 to arr size using size() method.
- Inside the loop defined if-else ladder.
- If element at index i is smaller than 0 then increment negative value.
- Else if element at index i is greater than 0 then increment positive value.
- Else increment zeros value.
- Declared float variables result1,result2 and result3 that stores the values of positive divided by arr size, negative divided by arr size & zeros divided by arr size.
- Finally printing the values of result1 and result2 and result3.
- Created the main class named PlusMinus; Inside defined the main method.
- Inside the main method created an object of BufferedReader br that takes user input using InputStreamReader object.
- Declared an integer variable n that stores user input and type casting it to integer using parseInt().
- Declared a List of Integer type named arr that stores user input after replacing the regular expression.
- Calling the plusMinus() method that takes arr as argument.
- Hence providing the output.
