- First we create a main class with main method.
- Then using string method trim we deleted all whitespaces in the beginning of the string and at end of the string.
- Then we define an if condition, that checks if the length of the string is equal to 0 or not.
- If the length is 0, then print 0 on the screen and exit the condition.
- Then we define a string array called s1.
- Splitting the string from the expression we don't need.
- Then print the length of s1 array.
- Then we declared a for loop that runs from 0 to the length of s1 array.
- Inside the loop, we print the elements at index i of the array s1.
- Hence giving us the desired output.
