- First created the main class with main method.
- Inside the main method, created an object of Scanner class named sc that takes user input.
- Then created an Integer variable named n that takes Integer user input.
- Then declared a String variable named s.
- Then defined a for loop that runs from 0 to n.
- Inside the loop, s stores the String user input.
- Then declared two String variables even and odd which are initialised to empty string.
- Then defined a for loop that runs from 0 to length of s using length() method.
- Inside the loop, defined an if-else condition.
- If iterator (j) is divisible by 2, then add a substring from j to j+1 to even variable.
- Else if iterator (j) is divided by 2 and provides 1 as result, then add a substring from j to j+1 to odd variable.
- Finally printing even and odd variable values.
- Hence providing the output.
