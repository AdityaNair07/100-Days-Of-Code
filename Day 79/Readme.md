<h1 align="center">Camel Case</h1>

- First created a class Result.
- Inside the class defined a static method integer return type camelcase() that takes String variable s as parameter.
- Inside the method declared an integer variable count that is initialised to 1.
- Then defined a for loop that runs from 0 to length of s.
- Inside the loop defined an if condition that checks if the character at ith index is in upper case.
- If yes then increment count variable.
- The method returns count.
- Inside the main class with main method.
- Inside the main method created an object of BufferedReader br that takes user input using object of InputStreamReader.
- Created an object of BufferedWriter bw that provides output using object of FileWriter.
- Declared a String variable s that stores String user input.
- Declared an integer variable result that stores the output of camelcase() that takes s as argument.
- Finally printing the result value.
- Hence providing the output.
